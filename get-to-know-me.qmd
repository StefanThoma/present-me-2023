# Project

Master Thesis in Statistics

Supervised by Werner Stahel and Martin Mächler

## Background

### Reproducibility Crisis in Psychology

-   Challanges

-   ManyLabs studies

### Measure of Relevance

-   Alternative to p-values by @stahel2021

-   Defined as:

    $$
    Rle = \frac{\hat{\theta}}{\zeta}
    $$

    ![Relevance Categories](images/categories.pdf)

## Aim

-   Implement relevance measure to ManyLabs studies.

-   #Were original studies relevant?

-   #Could studies be replicated?

## Approach

-   R Package for replicability

-   

## Findings

-   

## My Learning Journey

-   Separate Data from Results

-   Don't reinvent the wheel (use existing code-base)

-   Reduce dependencies

-

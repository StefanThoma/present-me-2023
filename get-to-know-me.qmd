# Project

Master Thesis in Statistics

NAME

Supervised by Werner Stahel and Martin Mächler

## Reproducibility Crisis in Psychology

![Estimated replication scores by @youyou2023](images/replication_score.jpg)

## ManyLabs Studies

-   Replication of priming study
-   N = 884
-   9 locations / teams

## Measure of Relevance

-   Alternative to p-values by @stahel2021

$Rle = \frac{\hat{\theta}}{\zeta}$

![Relevance Categories](images/categories.pdf)

## Aim

-   Implement Relevance measure to ManyLabs studies <!-- but really: write a good thesis -->

-   Create a reproducible and neat analysis pipeline

    -   Many similar analyses
    -   Avoid repetition

-   Build foundation for future research

## Approach

-   R Package for reproducibility

```{r}
#remotes::install_github("StefanThoma/ReplicationRelevance")
library(ReplicationRelevance)
```

## Approach

-   

## Findings

-   

## My Learning Journey

-   Separate Data from Results

-   Don't reinvent the wheel (use existing code-base)

-   Reduce dependencies
